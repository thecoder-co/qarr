  "about": "I've always been fascinated with computers and technology. My first encounter with code was in 2015, when I used HTML to create static websites and Scratch to create games. In 2020, I began coding in Python and Dart/Flutter, and I plan to increase my talents to encompass backend development in the near future. I spend my free time coding, watching YouTube videos, and scrolling around tiktok. I'd want to collaborate with you on making your app a reality.ðŸ¤“",
